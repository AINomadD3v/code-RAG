__pycache__/
*.egg-info/
*.egg

# CocoIndex specific (if it creates local cache/log files not in .venv)
# .cocoindex_cache/ # Example, if such a directory is created
# *.cocoindex_log # Example

# Evaluation output (if you use `cocoindex evaluate`)

# Environment variables
.env
.env.*
!/.env.example # It's good practice to commit an example env file

# Nix / Direnv
# ------------
.direnv/      # Direnv local state
result        # Common Nix build result symlink
result-* # Other result symlinks

# Docker
# -------
# If you have local data volumes mapped into your project directory (not common with named volumes)
# e.g., if postgres_data was a local folder:
# postgres_data/

# IDE / Editor specific
# ---------------------
.idea/        # JetBrains IDEs
.vscode/      # VSCode (consider committing .vscode/settings.json if it's project-specific and useful)
*.swp
*.swo

# OS specific
# -----------
.DS_Store     # macOS
Thumbs.db     # Windows
ehthumbs.db   # Windows

# Large Data / Source Code for Indexing
# -------------------------------------
# If the 'uiautomator2' directory is very large and you don't want to commit
# the raw source code you are indexing (e.g., if it's fetched from elsewhere
# or is a standard library you've copied in for indexing).
# If it's your own modified version or essential to the project's state,
# then DO NOT ignore it.
# uiautomator2/

# Log files
# ---------
*.log
logs/

# Coverage data
# -------------
.coverage
.coverage.*
htmlcov/
coverage.xml

# Other
# -----
# Add any other large files or generated directories specific to your workflow.
# For example, if sentence-transformers downloads models to a specific local path
# outside .venv (though it usually caches them in ~/.cache/huggingface or similar)
# .cache/ # Be careful with this, might be too broad
